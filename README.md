# My thoughts

## 1. Completing the test is a funny journey

- Actually, I have just started the test at 9 P.M 03/05/2022. I finished the test at 11:40 P.M.
- The test is not too difficult but I admit that it is the most suitable test to hire a frontend developer.
- Why? No questions about algorithms, focus only on the website technologies, and how candidates think to design child components.

## 2. My decision during the development process
- Nothing much to say. At first, I think that the size of the db.json file is too small. Thus, I intend to use the search functions by fetching all the records and filtering them at our frontend.
- However, It is a not good practice, right? I thought about Elastic Search right after that and decide to write a code that the backend is in charge of searching things.

## Conclusion
- Thank the recruitment team so much for your time interviewing me.
- Special thanks to Mr. Dong Phuong Nguyen. I know you were very busy on that day interviewing me. But I did not concentrate on the interview. I am so sorry and thank you very much for listening to me till the end of the interview.
- Hope who reviews my code will give me detailed feedbacks.
